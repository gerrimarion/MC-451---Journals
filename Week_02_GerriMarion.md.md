## Your Reflection

While reading the "Publishing Engine" chapter, I focused a lot on the ending of it. Specifically, the part that talks about overcoming code anxiety and how you'll be able to recognize errors overtime. 

I recently fought with this while trying to get GitHub to accept my student information. I went through its check-list, and still kept getting denied. I put in my billing and account information, I added the two-step authentication, and I took pictures of both sides of my student ID. Still, no success. The solution that I found was going to my student profile through Cougarnet, taking a screenshot of the entire page, then submitting that as my "ID." It went through no problem after that. 

In general, it's frustrating and can be discouraging at times. While it's great to recognize errors and try to go through things one by one, it's also extremely tedious. For me, my luck with technology and any kind of coding is not great. I'm used to getting errors and bugs when I've tried to play The Sims 4, or trying to get the EA App to work (which is hardly ever.) But, it does help to have issues early on. It helps provide an easier solution or path for someone else, if they have issues, as well as being able to recognize errors in case they come back up later. I try to be as thorough as possible whenever I have issues so others don't have to fight as hard as I did.
