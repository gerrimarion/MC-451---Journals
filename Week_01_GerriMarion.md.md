## Your Reflection

*(Note: This was written from the textbook in the syllabus and not the one posted afterwards. I'll write a part two for the correct one afterwards and make them both available. Sorry about that!)*

While reading the first chapter of the semester, I noticed the repetition of something that is extremely important: ethics. Specifically, how the big things are informed consent, confidentiality, and the minimizing of possible harms that could happen during research. 

The reading touches on this briefly, but it's also a thought I've been having as more of our lives transfer online with the Digital Age. Personally, I've tried to keep myself as offline as possible, but what I do choose to post is what I'm allowing for others to see. However, I've noticed a trend when talking about privacy and informed consent. On apps like TikTok, some will post videos that end up trending. 

I noticed this often with people who post about their relationships on TikTok and complaining about their partner failing them in some way. The video ends up going viral, and the comments flood in wondering why they're still together. What I noticed afterwards is the OP posting a response saying something along the lines of "I did not expect this to blow up the way it did." In that statement alone, does that imply that they actually wanted privacy and did not consent to their video going viral? If that's the case, why choose to upload knowing that risk is possible? 

Then again, expecting someone to private their account to avoid a viral video risk sounds odd to me. I liked how the chapter specifies that the user may perceive their data as private and the newfound complexities of the Digital age. No one knows what their posts or videos are going to be used for, or what will happen to them.
