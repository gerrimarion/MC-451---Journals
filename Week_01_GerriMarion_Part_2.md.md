# Week X: [The Connector Part 2 - Week 1]

**Date:** [1/15/2026]
**Phase:** [Communication Liasion]
**Approach Used:** [Connector]

## Your Reflection

*(Note: this is the "part two" of the week 1. I accidentally read and wrote the journal entry for the textbook in the syllabus, and not the one provided later. I'm including both to be safe!)*

When talking about "Mapping Narrative Structure on Research Design," I focused on the example provided the most. Mostly because it's something I may want to expand on. 

"Cozy" games are a newer thing; something that came out a couple of years after Covid. However, I noticed a couple of things that games considered "cozy" fall into. For one, they tend to focus on "chores" or some kind of "work" simulator. Farming games, for example, focus on the "chore" part of the game: raising animals, tending a garden, decorations, building relationships, etc. Other games focus on the decorating and running of a business: bookstores, grocery stores, and so on.

That's not to say people don't find those things enjoyable, nor can they be cozy, but it does bring me to my second thing: they seem to be targeted towards women. Fashionable clothes, romance, in-depth character design, and design elements that focus more on the "cutesy" things. 

One of my interests is how gender plays into media and society, so this is something I'd like to look into deeper. Personally, I play some of the typical cozy games because it can be relaxing, or have an in-depth story going on in the background. I also have guy friends who love Stardew Valley, which makes me wonder why cozy games make their initial target audience for women. Is it an initial assumption that women would prefer games that are "easier" or "not as involved?"
