## Your Reflection

I'm definitely in the progression portion of my research. I took a Gender and Society course last spring, and since then I've fascinated by how social construction around gender plays into different parts of life. With me being in Mass Comm, I'm always looking for themes or trends in media and connecting it to gender and gender roles. 

However, I know that gender and media is a very large topic. It's extremely broad and can play into a lot of different things. Usually, my focus is in horror movies, but I wanted to challenge myself and look into gaming. I know that cozy games are growing in popularity, and that's when I also noticed common themes: target audience is mostly women, and the gaming mechanics are chore-type. (farming, fishing, decorating, etc.) 

At first, I wanted to look into why that is, but that was solved fairly quickly through Bordeau's article. There's not a set definition of what constitutes a cozy game, but the overall idea is relaxation, simplicity, and "connectedness." It's meant to be games that have the "vibes" of comfort and coziness, which is also subjective depending on what game or person you're asking. 

This is what led me to my current stance. I'm curious as to how other genders, specifically men, play cozy games, if they do at all. I think I'm on the right track with the Uses and Gratifications theory since I want to see how different genders are playing and interacting with cozy games. The only issue I'm having a hard time with is how to collect the data. Originally, I wanted to look at Twitch streamers (10 men and 10 women) to see how they go about the different gameplay options (character customization, fishing, farming, romance/interacting, etc.), but I don't know if that's realistic or would bring an accurate reflection. I'd like to do a survey, but I'm not sure how I'd go about that either. For now, I'm content with what I want to look into and the theory being used. I just need that last part of the triad to make it work.
