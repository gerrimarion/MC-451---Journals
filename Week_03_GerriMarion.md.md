## Your Reflection

While reading Chapter 3 and diving into the different ways of knowing, I focused a lot on authority. As we grow up and, especially in early college courses, we're taught that your best sources are from an expert in their field. They're credible, and therefore shouldn't be questioned. You should be able to take their professional word and lean on that as viable proof of whatever topic is currently being discussed. 

However, I like that this chapter points out the strengths *and* weaknesses behind these different ways of knowing. It shows that two things can be true at the same time. Yes, experts in a field can definitely be credible and be able to explain what's going on or bring some insight into a conversation, but it can very easily be biased because of that. If an expert has a biased opinion in their field, then there's a strong chance they won't be interrogated as harshly because they're the expert. 

On the other side of things, I've noticed that our society grills our experts more than usual. It seems like, in the age of mis- and disinformation, that our society can't bring themselves to trust their own experts anyway. They'll take whatever an expert is trying to say as "fake news," or something along those lines. I won't touch on this too much as I'm aware that religion is a sensitive topic, but I do have personal connections to this. 

When Neil DeGrasse Tyson talks about the existence of God, he tends to fall under an agnostic category. He can't confirm or deny that a God exists, and he only knows what he knows about space rather than religion. People who do believe in God see this as a "gotcha" moment, or that because he can't make a substantial claim like that, it means they're right. We also saw a lot of grilling authorities during COVID, when medical professionals and scientists were encouraging masks and the vaccine but the public claimed that those things were actually unsafe or "fake news."
