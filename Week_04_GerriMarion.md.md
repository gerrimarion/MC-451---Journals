# Week X: [Week 4]

**Date:** [2/3/2026]
**Phase:** [Architect]
**Approach Used:** [Connector]

## Your Reflection

While reading Chapter 4, I realized that a lot of what's discussed is familiar to me. I remember working with Boonlean operators during my first semester of college, as well as having to download and use Zotero that same year. I like that I'll be able to refamiliarize myself with these tools and will hopefully come easier to me since I've worked on them in the past. 

That being said, I loved the explanation of Googling something versus actual intelligence gathering. It feels silly to say that I wasn't aware of the difference, but it makes significantly more sense having read the chapter. I do a lot of "Googling" when it comes to surface-level research. I'll research things on Google Scholar or through the Lovejoy Library archives, but I do realize that I'm using a Googling method and not an intelligence gathering method. I usually bookmark a bunch of different studies that I find, then sort through them later. I should be trying to do it the other way so I can utilize these tools properly, and in a more organized way. 

Recognizing this early will also be extremely beneficial when I begin my research. I want to be able to sort different games, gameplay, and target audiences into their places, and I can't do that if I'm Googling and bookmarking everything I find that has key words in them. However, I can use tools such as Zotero to keep me on track and be able to sort them into their specific category.
