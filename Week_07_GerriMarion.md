# Week X: [Week 7]

**Phase:** [Architect]
**Approach Used:** [Troubleshooter]

## Your Reflection

I did not think that forming the official research question would be this difficult. 

The chapter talks about it being the hardest part, but I thought I had a solid question that didn't need much adjusting. Until I switched around my data collection method and set up my variables. 

Since then, I've been bouncing back and forth between what I'm wanting to focus. I'm using 10 men and 10 women and their "First 100 Days of Stardew Valley" videos as my variables, amongst other things that still need tweaking. I've been shifting around my idea as well to figure out exactly what it is I'm trying to look for. 

I know I want to look into how different genders are playing cozy games and why, and I chose Stardew Valley because it's the most recognizable as a cozy game besides Animal Crossing. That, and a lot of other game trailers say things like "it's like Stardew Valley meets [X]," making it the best way to bring in a similar, cozy game-type audience. However, I'm trying to see how they're using the specific gameplay mechanics and options. 

When you play a videogame, there's a specific thing you're drawn to the most to bring out the most gratification, but I'm not sure if that same gratification will show while I'm doing my research. So, I end up circling back to my original research question to try and figure out where to go from here. 

The prospectus definitely helps since it combines both ideas, but I want something stable before I begin to choose different YouTubers and Twitch Streamers and their content. I'm still troubleshooting it, but I know I'll figure it out.
