## Your Reflection

Talking about the Mass Communications specific theories, I focused heavily on the Parasocial Interaction theory. While it may not have much to do with my current project, it's something that I've noticed happening quite a bit since COVID. 

I talked about this recently with a friend of mine and how the death of Catherine O'Hara effected us both deeply. We were absolutely heartbroken and in denial about her death, and a similar thing happened when Robin Williams passed away in 2014. He was one of my favorite actors, and still is to this day, but his death was such a shock. I remember being so genuinely hurt by his passing, even though he had no idea who I am and there's no relationship established besides a parasocial one. Same thing with Catherine O'Hara. She had no idea who me or my friend were; we've never met, but me and her were heavily impacted by her passing. 

When talking about COVID, parasocial relationships skyrocketed as more people moved to TikTok and Twitch, even YouTube at times. I liked the example of how it works with Twitch in the chapter, and it makes sense if it operates in a similar manner for TikTok influencers. A TikTok influencer will be on Live and talk to their fanbase, said fanbase will gift them roses or galaxies, and the influencer will acknowledge it to form that connection. With the passing of a celebrity though, that comes more with enjoying the films or shows they're in and building the relationship that way.

As for my personal project, I'm not entirely sure which theory to use. My main focus is on the gender breakdowns of the cozy game genre, but I'm not sure if it fits the Social Identity theory or the Uses and Gratifications theory. It could go either way since cozy games as a whole are in response to toxic masculinity in gaming spaces, but it could also be looked at as a form of entertainment. Focusing more on what people do with cozy games. 

Update 2/11/2026 - After going through my main article that I'm using as my foundation for cozy games as a whole, Uses and Gratification Theory fits the best. My main hypothesis is that different genders play "cozy games" in different way. I predict that anyone who identifies as a woman or more flexible on the gender spectrum (nonbinary, genderfluid, etc.) will focus on all aspects of a cozy game while anyone who identifies as a man will primarily focus on any aspects that include fighting, mining, or anything that can closely relate to conflict seen in masculine games.
